                <p>
                    There are many reasons to spend a vacation in Irota – many of them can be found on this website. Friendly people, unspoilt nature, the traditional and well-kept village, eco-friendly facilities, natural produce…

                    The region has a downside as well, which is underdevelopment. The area is traditionally agrarian and until the modernisations of the twentieth century it fitted the feudal pattern typical in this part of Europe: a select group of landowners ruled over many serfs and smallholders. Once modernisation started under the communist regime from 1945, it focused mainly on mining and industry. The majority of the workforce, including the relatively large group of Roma in the region, was therefore  employed in these sectors. After the collapse of communist Hungary, mining as well as industry largely disappeared and unemployment rates rose significantly. Especially among Roma this is still very high.

                    To what extent will you 'notice' these circumstances? Crime is no reason for concern. You'll soon find that the roads, although already replaced and repaired in many places, are sometimes in poor condition. The nearest shops in Edelény - twenty kilometres away from Irota – are good for everyday shopping, but you are not likely to find the diversity here that you are probably used to at home (think quality wines, Belgian chocolates, foreign cheeses, many kinds of bread, an exquisite meat assortment etc.). An extensive product range you can expect at the TESCO hypermarket in Kazincbarcika - which is a forty-five minute drive away. In short, there's not much that can really not be found, but it does take some planning and effort. The same holds true for the local hospitality industry. Edelény has exactly one (simple) restaurant and a pizzeria, in Kazincbarcika there is a wider selection of places. For real fine dining the 'Anyukam Mondta' restaurant in Encs with its reputation of national scope is highly recommended - but it will take you an hour to get there.

                    And then there is the language barrier. Hungary with its language incomprehensible non-Hungarians is not known for its foreign-language skills to begin with - which is striking even in tourist spots like Budapest and Lake Balaton. The chance that you will come across English- or German-speaking sales staff / waiters / pump attendants in our region is close to zero. However, they will usually go out their way to help you. Gestures and signs go a long way, restaurants often use a multi-lingual menu - and that small phrasebook / dictionary is indispensable. For specific cases or in situations where more than the very basic is required, you can always rely on us.
